# Some special cases for expressions.

# Uninitialized variables evaluate to empty-string.
print x ;
print "\n" ;

# Values that don't parse as doubles evaluate to zero.
print x + 1 ;
print "\n" ;

print "abc" + 5 ;
print "\n" ;

# empty string evaluates to false.
if ( x )
  print "This should not print\n" ;

# but zero doesn't evaluate to false in this language.
y = 0 ;
if ( y )
  print "This should print\n" ;
