# Showing that, without parentheses, we just get left-to-right
# evaluation order, with no attention to precedence.  If you
# do the extra credit, you'll fail this test (but it won't cost
# you anything if you get the extra credit tests right).

# Exactly what you'd expect, left-to-right evaluation order.
print 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 ;
print "\n" ;

# With our kind-of-dumb parser, this will do the add before
# the multiply.
print 1 + 2 * 3 ;
print "\n" ;

# Same here, add before divide.
print 1 + 2 / 3 ;
print "\n" ;

# But here the multiply goes first, since it's on the left.
print 2 * 3 + 1 ;
print "\n" ;
